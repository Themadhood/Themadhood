# Greetins, I'm Themadhood Pequot  
**Founder & Developer at Themadhood Codes**  
**Python Engineer | Automation Architect | Systems Designer**

I build tools, engines, and automation systems that solve real problems.  
Through **Themadhood Codes**, I focus on creating scalable software, world-generation engines, error-resilient frameworks, and custom automation tools for both industrial and creative applications.

My work blends practical engineering with large-system architecture — from industrial machine programming to multi-layer simulation engines.

## 🚀 Projects by *Themadhood Codes*

### **RepoSync — Automated Repository Management Framework**
RepoSync is a professional-grade automation tool developed by **Themadhood Codes** to eliminate repetitive manual workflows and standardize code deployment across multiple projects and environments.

Designed to support both standalone applications and large, multi-repo ecosystems like the THEMADHOOD Library, RepoSync automates synchronization, packaging, versioning, and distribution with minimal user input.

RepoSync provides:
- **One-Click Repository Synchronization**  
  Push, pull, merge, update, or replicate entire projects automatically  
- **Automated Versioning Pipeline**  
  Generates version files, stamps builds, and tracks change histories  
- **Cross-Platform Build Support**  
  Includes PyInstaller integration, asset bundling, and executable packaging  
- **Smart Conflict Prevention**  
  Detects mismatched files, missing modules, and outdated dependencies before sync  
- **Backup & Recovery Tools**  
  Create restore points, rollback versions, and protect critical project data  
- **Integrated Error Module Support**  
  Full error logging, upload reporting, retry logic, and safe-mode fallback  
- **Environment Validation**  
  Checks for missing files, broken dependencies, invalid settings, and corruption  
- **Configurable Sync Profiles**  
  Define custom paths, include/exclude rules, build modes, and project templates  
- **Developer Utilities**  
  Automatic changelog generation, cleanup routines, and diagnostic exports  

RepoSync is designed to scale — from single-file utilities to multi-module frameworks — making it a central tool in the THEMADHOOD development workflow.


### **THEMADHOOD Library**
The THEMADHOOD Library is a multi-language ecosystem engineered by **Themadhood Codes**.  
Each language has its own dedicated library (`_Python`, `_C`, `_CSharp`, `_Bash`, etc.), each containing:

- **Custom error-handling modules**
- **Code templates and scaffolding tools**
- **Reusable logic blocks and problem-solving patterns**
- **Private APIs for internal services** (Google Sheets, Sheets-based databases, metadata stores, automation endpoints)
- **Copy/paste-ready examples** to accelerate development across all projects

This structure allows updates to be made in *one* central repo instead of maintaining duplicated logic across multiple platforms, languages, or environments.

The THEMADHOOD Library acts as the backbone for:
- Application development  
- Engine and simulation systems  
- Automation tools (e.g., RepoSync)  
- Backend utilities  
- Game and world logic (via EVG foundations)  
- Cross-language consistency and rapid prototyping  

### **EVG — Evolutionary Sandbox Board Game & Engine**
EVG began in 2015 as a physical board game where players and mobs evolve, grow, and interact within an open sandbox environment.  
In 2020, development expanded into a full software adaptation, transforming EVG into a modular, programmable game engine built on top of the THEMADHOOD Library.

EVG blends elements of Zombicide-style tactical gameplay with D&D-style character progression, while remaining completely open-ended and evolution-driven.

The EVG engine includes:
- **Player and Mob Evolution Systems**  
  Growth paths, stat progression, skills, and adaptive traits  
- **Dynamic Combat & Interaction Logic**  
  Turn structure, action resolution, modifiers, and reactive events  
- **Item, Class, and Ability Frameworks**  
  Modular systems for equipment, roles, powers, and unique builds  
- **Sandbox Gameplay Architecture**  
  No fixed narrative; players shape the world through actions  
- **Map & Environment Integration**  
  Optional procedural generation via THEMADHOOD Library (not required)  
- **Entity Management**  
  Players, mobs, objects, loot, interactables, triggers, and hazards  
- **Simulation Backbone**  
  Event pipelines, turn order, effect stacking, and world updates  

EVG is not a world generator.  
It is a **complete sandbox game system** with its own ruleset, evolution mechanics, and programmable framework — the generator is simply one tool the engine can use.

EVG continues to evolve as a long-term flagship project within the THEMADHOOD ecosystem.


### **Themadhood Codes Error Module Framework**
Every THEMADHOOD Library includes its own custom Error Module — a full diagnostic and recovery framework designed to maintain stability, protect user data, and provide developers with actionable information.

Key Features:

#### **1. Error Categorization**
- Critical  
- Warning  
- Recoverable  
- User-correctable  
- Developer-only  

#### **2. Central Error Dispatcher**
A unified entry point that routes all errors to:
- Logging  
- Upload reporting  
- Popups / UI messages  
- Retry systems  
- Safe-mode fallback  
- Shutdown handlers  

#### **3. Error Codes & Tags**
- Unique identifiers for every error  
- Searchable, trackable, and UI-friendly  

#### **4. Structured Error Objects**

- Use backups  
- Enter safe mode  

#### **8. Graceful Shutdown Handler**
- Captures final crash state  
- Saves last session details  
- Performs final error dump  
- Exits safely  

#### **9. Real-Time Error Stats**
- Counts per severity  
- Time-based tracking  
- Suitable for dashboards or analytics  

#### **10. Error Deduplication**

- Reduces noise  

#### **11. Context Capture**
- Safe variable snapshots  
- Last user actions

- Email  
- Discord webhook  
- Local text logs  
(*Critical-only when necessary*)  

#### **15. User Action Suggestions**
- Retry  
- Reset  
- Restart
